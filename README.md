## Thing-a-Week-Bonus-Content
-----
Repository for Euler challenges and similar code for [Thing a Week](http://codeaweek.tumblr.com/).

This repo for simple scripts and code examples. Fizzbin, anyone?

Many challenges are likely to be sourced from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Karan's project list](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

Not planning to fork from Karan's list as there may be multiple sources.
